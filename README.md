🏡 **Homelab Projects & Learning Journey**
<br>

**Welcome to my Homelab Repository!**

This repo is a living journal of my progress in IT, networking, security, and systems — all the projects I work on outside of my academic coursework. It’s where I document what I’m building, breaking, fixing, and learning along the way.

🌱 **Purpose**

Showcase my growth and technical skills in real-world scenarios.

Document my experiments, configs, and lessons learned.

Serve as a personal reference for future me (and anyone else starting their own homelab).

<br>

**🔧 What You’ll Find Here**

Networking → VLANs, firewall rules, segmentation experiments.

Virtualization → Proxmox, TrueNAS, VM/CT setups.

Security → Pen-testing labs, monitoring, hardening practices.

Automation & Scripting → Bash, PowerShell, Python snippets.

Miscellaneous Projects → Anything I tinker with outside school.

<br>


**📈 Why This Repo Exists**

This is less about polished “production-ready” code and more about:

Tracking progress → so I can look back and see growth.

Learning in public → mistakes included.

Building a portfolio → showing employers and peers how I learn and apply IT concepts.

<br>

**🚀 Goals**

Develop strong foundations in cybersecurity, networking, and system administration.

Gain hands-on practice to complement my academic studies.

Contribute back by sharing configs, notes, and experiments.

<br>

**🤝 Contributions**

This repo is primarily personal, but suggestions, resources, or feedback are always welcome! Feel free to open an issue or drop a pull request.

**📌 Disclaimer**

Most of what’s here comes from self-learning and experimentation.
Don’t assume it’s best practice — use it as inspiration and adapt for your own setup.
