## 📌 Summary
This section will cover the initial setup of my Unifi home network, and any issues i encountered along the way.

## 🖥️ Environment / Context 
- OS/Firmware:  Unifi OS 4.3.9 / Network 9.3.45
- Location: ==**Home Lab**==

## ⚙️ Configuration
- Controller: UniFi Network Application v 9.3.45
- Gateway: UCG Ultra (firmware 4.3.9)
- Switch: UniFi 8-port PoE
- Access Points:
  - U7 Lite (Living Room) 
  - U7 Lite (Main Bedroom) 
  - U7 LR (Backyard) 

## 🚨 Troubleshooting / Errors
- **Error:**  Access Points weren't connecting to adopt on unifi console. Was getting POE power to the AP but no connection to it. 

- **How it was fixed:**  Cabling Issue had to re-terminate cables . 

- **Error**: Wifi is now faster than before, However ethernet seemed to take a hit. Speeds used to be around 750-800+ mbps but now are sitting at 400-560 mbps.

- **How it was fixed:** TBD (See Future Project Titles)
## ✅ Outcome
- **What worked in the end**  
-Re-terminating cables helped with connections. 
- **Lessons learned**  
-Ethernet tester showed lights 1-8 however that doesn't mean the cabling is in the right order so worth to invest in a better tester down the road. For now just re-terminating until it was fixed worked fine.

- Links, docs, or tutorials use
-Chat GPT to troubleshoot, but to no avail. Found cabling issue on a whim by trying the AP with a random cable i had laying around.
